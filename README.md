# Two-cluster-test
A statistical framework for testing whether two subsets originate from the same cluster, with applications in tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical clustering.

Two-cluster-test contains the following .py files:
- Run main clustering evaluation: `main.py`
- Test subsets from the **same** cluster: `same_cluster.py`
- Test subsets from **different** clusters: `different_cluster.py`
- Compute a combined p-value for two subsets: `two_cluster_test.py`
